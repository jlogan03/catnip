//! Address Resolution Protocol implementation with generation of requests and responses to received requests.
//! 
//! This is a noisy and frequently nondeterministic process, but on a statically-addressed network, it will only occur once
//! during network initialization or if a host resets its network drivers and needs to re-connect.
//! 
//! ARP is not a distinct network abstraction layer, but is still required for most networks to function
//! because socket abstractions frequently require an ARP request and response to be completed before sending data
//! even if the router is actually going to be handling the association between MAC addresses and IP addresses,
//! so resolving the target's MAC address is not explicitly necessary.
//! 
//! This process is not useful on a statically-addressed network, but on a mixed statically-and-dynamically-addressed network, it can help
//! in the case where the target device does exist on the network, but has not yet sent a packet and does not have an entry in the
//! router/switch's MAC address table. In that case, the broadcasted ARP request will still reach that device and produce a response,
//! which will be noted by the router/switch and allow its MAC address table entry to be populated.
//! 
//! It can also be useful for networks with not-smart network switches where the hosts all choose their own static addresses,
//! because ARP allows each host on the network to poll the others to check if an address is already taken before assigning
//! that address to itself. The success of that method requires that all devices on the network be configured to respond to ARP requests,
//! which is not necessarily the case.
